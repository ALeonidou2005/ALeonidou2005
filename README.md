# About me

I am Andreas Leonidou from Cyprus and since I was 12 years old, when I first found out about programming, programming became my passion and my main way of expressing my creativity and instict need to create something mine.

## Programming Languages
- Main: C++
- Fluent: C, C# for Unity, Python
- Used at least once: Java, Visual Basic, Matlab, Javascript

## Experience
- Competitive Programming: I am a competitive programming exeprt on Codeforces. Succeeded in the COI (Cyprus Olympiad in Informatics) twice and as a result had the opportunity to compete in the IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics) and BOI (Balkan Olympiad in Informatics) in 2023 and 2024. My best competitive programming achievement was receiving an Honorable Mention in the IOI 2024 in Egypt.
- Robotics: Built and programmed robots for years. I started of with LEGO Mindstorms competing 3 times in the national Robotex Coompetition were I failed spectacularly. Then, I moved on to a new challange, the FTC (First Tech Challenge), were I was the team leader of my school's team. We managed to win the national FTC 2022 competition, and had the unique opportunity of competing to compete in the FTC Championship international competition in Houston, Texas, USA.
- Game Development / App Development: Have developed multiple games from scratch using Unity and C#. Three of my projects that stand out are the "Bounce-Run" casual video game which I published on the App Store and Play Store, the "MaClock" clock utility application which I published in the Mac App Store and the "ASP - Army Scheduler Project" which was I project I contributed to the Cypriot National Guard highly automating the process of scheduling making scheduling much faster and fairer.
- Other Programming Projects:
  - Etchical hacking: Experimented with low-level backdoor programs written in C. Also, written some web-scraping programs with Python as part of data mining or DoS attack projects.
  - IPC (Inter Program Communication): Used IPC techniques like threading, cloning, and pipes in a few programs I've written in C++.
  - Socket Programming: Worked with low-level sockets in C.

## Currently...
- I'm working on the 'Thalasat' team project. A project aiming to use sattelite data to analyse, predict and ultimately prevent bad sea phenomena like Algal Blooms or Coral Reefs. This project is done as part of the
