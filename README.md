# About me

I am Andreas Leonidou from Cyprus and since I was twelve years old, when I first found out about programming, programming became my passion and my main way of expressing my creativity and intrinsic need to create something on my own.
<br><br>
## Experience
- **Competitive Programming:** <br> I am a competitive programming exeprt on Codeforces. Ranked 3rd nationally in the COI (Cyprus Olympiad in Informatics) twice and as a result had the opportunity to compete in the IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics) and BOI (Balkan Olympiad in Informatics) in 2023 and 2024. My best competitive programming achievement was receiving an Honorable Mention in the IOI 2024 in Egypt.
- **Robotics:** <br> Built and programmed robots for years. I started off with LEGO Mindstorms competing three times in the national Robotex Coompetition where I failed spectacularly year after year. Then, I moved on to a new challange, the FTC (First Tech Challenge), were I was the team leader of my school's team. We managed to win the national FTC 2022 competition, and had the unique opportunity of competing in the FTC Championship international competition in Houston, Texas, USA.
- **Game Development / App Development:** <br> Have developed multiple games from scratch using Unity and C#. Three of my projects that stand out are: the "Bounce-Run" casual video game which I published on the App Store and Play Store, the "MaClock" clock utility application which I published in the Mac App Store and the "ASP - Army Scheduler Project" which was is an application I made and contributed to the Cypriot National Guard highly automating the process of scheduling making daily scheduling much faster, more efficient and fairer.
- **Other Programming Projects:**
  - Etchical hacking: Experimented with low-level backdoor programs written in C. Also, written web-scraping programs with Python as part of some data mining and DoS attack projects I worked on.
  - IPC (Inter-Process Communication): Used IPC techniques like threading, cloning, and pipes in a few programs I've written in C++.
  - Socket Programming: Worked with low-level sockets in C.
<br><br>
## Programming Languages
- Main: C++
- Fluent: C, C# for Unity, Python
- Used at least once: Java, Visual Basic, Matlab, Javascript
<br><br>
## Currently...
- I'm working on the 'Thalasat' team project which is a project for the VeneTo Stars Challenge 2025 (Supporting the Blue & Space Economy). Our project aims to use sattelite data to analyse, predict and ultimately prevent harmful sea phenomena like Algal Blooms or Coral Reefs.
- I'm learning web development and focus on improving my Python knowledge. Lately I've also took a deeper dive into Python's internals.
