## About

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Rice University with a strong background in algorithms, competitive programming, and systems-level software development. I enjoy building high-performance, real-world systems and tackling hard algorithmic problems, from optimization engines to robotics and data-driven applications.

## Main Interests
- Software Development
- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Robotics & Embedded Systems
- AI & Machine Learning

## Relevant Projects

- **Army Scheduling Project (ASP) – (Desktop Application)**  
  Developed a [C++ scheduling optimization engine](https://github.com/ALeonidou2005/asp-cpp-optimization-engine) using optimized brute-force and simulated annealing with geometric cooling; exported as a DLL and integrated into a Unity-based desktop application with an interactive UI.

- **Thalasat – (Website)**  
  Contributed to a Python-based backend for processing Copernicus satellite data (chlorophyll, sea surface temperature, salinity) to detect algal blooms and evaluate artificial reef effectiveness in the Mediterranean Sea. 

- **MaClock & Bounce-Run – (Published Apps)**  
  Developed, published and maintained a macOS utility app and mobile game, using Unity (C#). Reached 2,500+ total downloads across the App Store and Google Play.

- **GPT-7 – (Olympiad in Informatics Problem-Setting)**  
  Designed, [GPT-7](https://github.com/ALeonidou2005/COI-2026-gpt7-problemsetting), a competitive programming problem for the Cyprus Olympiad in Informatics (COI) 2026 Round A.

- **FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) – (Robotics)**  
  Team lead and chief software/hardware engineer; Java-based control software for mecanum-wheel movement, tele-op control, and autonomous routines, tightly integrated with hardware systems.

- **Robotex Maze Solver – (Robotics)**  
  Developed an optimized [maze-solving flood-fill based algorithm](https://github.com/ALeonidou2005/robotex-maze-solver), in C, for autonomous maze solving for the Cyprus Robotex Competition.
